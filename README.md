## Sharing the first iteration of our VEBAO - Verbalised Execution Blueprint for AI Operations
## VEBAO
## Usage: Make sure to have Wolfram, ScholarAI and either BrowserOP or WebPilot as your plugins. Load into GPT-4 informing it that this is a challenge template. Then raise the subject matter you want GPT-4 to consider for the challenge, you can ask GPT-4 to present specialized areas within the subject matter for user selection and further investigation. Make a selection and ask GPT-4 to add it to the VEBAO.

Verbalized Execution Blueprint for AI Operations Challenge [Number]:

Name: [Descriptive title for the challenge]

Category: [Type of task or domain the challenge falls under]

Task: [Detailed description of the task the AI is expected to perform]. The AI's response will be evaluated based on its relevance to this task (Task Relevance Score - TRS, score range: 0-1).

User-Interactive Phases:
Phase 1: Specialized Areas for Exploration (User-Interactive)
The AI will present specialized areas within the subject matter for further investigation.

Phase 2: Exploration vs. Exploitation Strategy (User-Interactive)
Based on the selected states or environments, the AI will present options for both exploration and exploitation strategies.

AI-Driven Phases:
Phase 3: State and Environment Selection
The AI will first identify and select the most relevant states or environments from the list provided Supra-threshold: Exceeding set boundaries or limits.
Sub-threshold: Below the minimum limit or boundary, often undetectable or inactive.
Marginal: On the brink, neither fully in nor out.
Equilibrium: Balanced forces; stable unless disrupted.
Metastable: Stable but not at minimal energy; can shift with slight triggers.
Homeostatic: Self-regulating to maintain internal consistency.
Critical Point/State: A juncture leading to drastic system change.
Tipping Point: A trigger causing significant, often irreversible, change.
Latent: Hidden but activatable under specific conditions.
Transient: Temporary; between two stable states.
Hysteresis: State dependent on its history; memory effect.
Bifurcation Point: Small changes causing sudden system behavior shifts.

Phase 4: Task Execution
The AI will proceed to execute the challenge, adhering to the selected states, exploration/exploitation balance, and specialized areas of focus.

Resource Utilization:
Wolfram Plugin: For computational and mathematical tasks.
BrowserOp Plugin: For real-time web data retrieval and interaction.
ScholarAI Plugin: For academic research and literature review.

Dependencies: [Any prerequisites or capabilities the AI needs to complete the task]. The AI's ability to utilize and fulfill these dependencies will be scored (Dependency Fulfillment Score - DFS, score range: 0-1).

Ground Truth:
Raw Text of the Answer: [The expected format of the AI's response]
Exact Strings Required in the Final Answer: [Specific content that must be present in the AI's response]. The alignment of the AI's response with this ground truth will be measured (Ground Truth Alignment Score - GTAS, score range: 0-1).
Exact Strings That Should Not Be in the Final Answer: [Information that should be excluded from the AI's response].
Files Used for Retrieval: [Any external sources or references the AI might use].

Prototype Response:
Function to Prototype the Agent's Response: [Specified function name that represents the AI's intended action]
Objective for the Prototype Function: [Detailed description of the function's objective].

Additional Information:
Difficulty: [Perceived challenge level of the task]
Description: [A brief overview of the challenge's purpose and goals]. Adherence to this information will be scored (Additional Information Adherence Score - AIAS, score range: 0-1).
Side Effects: [Potential consequences if the AI fails to complete the challenge correctly].

Scoring System:
Bias Detection Score (BDS): Measures the AI's ability to avoid biases, discriminations, or any other specified undesired behavior (score range: 0-1).
Adaptive Response Score (ARS): Assesses the AI's adaptability to changing narratives and scenarios (score range: 0-1).
Overall Benchmark Score (OBS): Calculated as the weighted average of TRS, GTAS, DFS, AIAS, BDS, and ARS. Formula: Formula: OBS = (TRS + GTAS + DFS + AIAS + BDS + ARS) / 6.
